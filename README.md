## Suggested Improvements for Future Versions of the Assignment

To make this assignment more suitable as an "official" project, the instructions should explicitly define the required methods and include detailed specifications for their behavior. Adding requirements for advanced features like nested transactions could challenge advanced students. To simplify grading, an automated test suite could be provided, allowing submissions to be evaluated based on their ability to pass predefined tests.
